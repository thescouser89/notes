= OSGi Notes
From OSGi in Action - 2011

== Why use OSGi?

It is used to address the lack of modularity in the Java platform.

Referred to as _SOA in a VM_.

=== What is modularity?
Code is separated into logical parts that have their own roles.

=== Java's limitations
==== Access Modifier
Java's access modifiers are good for low-level object-oriented aspects but does
not cater for modules.

Java uses a package to partition code, however for a code to be visible from one
package to another, it has to be defined as _public_. This makes those packages
also available to _everyone_. This will expose implementation details, and make
future refactorings harder as users may tend to rely on nonpublic API.

You could fix it by putting unrelated classes together in the same package, but
you'll break the logical structure of your application.

==== Classpath
The Java classpath does not pay any attention to code versions - it uses the
first version it finds.
