== Closest Pair Heuristic
----
ClosestPair(P)
    let n be the number of points in P
    for i = 1 to n - 1 do
        d = inf
        for each pair of endpoints (s_i, t) from distinct vertex chain
            if (dist(s,t) <= d) s_m = s, t_m = t, d = dist(s,t)
        connect(s_m, t_m) to an edge
    connect the two endpoints by an edge
----

So try to connect s to its closest neighbor to form a pair.

e.g
----
-21                  -5 -1 0 1  3        11
----

0 is connected to points 1 and -1.

But still not optimal solution

== Optimal solution algoritm to solve closest pair/closest neighbor problem

OptimalTSP
    d = inf
    for each n! permutations Pi of point set P
        if cost(Pi) <= d then d = cost(Pi) and P_min = Pi
    return P_min
