== NearestNeighbor(n)
----
Visit initial point p~0 from P
p = p~0
i = 0
While there are unvisited points
 i = i + 1
 Select p~i -> closest point to p~{i - 1}
 Visit p~i

Return to point p~0 from p~{ n - 1}
----

This works well but does not provide the optimal result in a lot of cases.

See closest pair heuristic

e.g
----
-21                  -5 -1 0 1  3        11
----

It you start at 0, you'll jump to 1, -1, 3, -5, 11 then -21.

Optimal solution would be to start at -21 and walk right till your reach 11.
